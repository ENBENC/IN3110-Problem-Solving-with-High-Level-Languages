(Total)Runtime running numba_color2gray after 3 runs :0.515851
(Per run)Average runtime running numba_color2gray after 3 runs :0.171950

Average runtime for running numba_color2gray is 16.302 times faster than python_color2gray .py.

Average runtime for running numba_color2gray is 9.044 times slower than numpy_color2gray .py

Timing performed using : timeit

Advantages of using numba, numba help the code to run faster. A pure python code as we saw in the tests is 
slower than running with numba. If we have code that have many loops in it, then running with numba will give a better result
than running a pure python code.

Disadvantages in the numba vs numpy comparison, the numba is slower than the numpy. Numba is not always faster than numpy,
and it can be slower. 
I think it dependents on how the code is implemented, numbers of loops and data size. So when we have to choose whitch one we 
want to use depend on what the code do and how it is implemented.
